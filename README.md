## üöÄ Getting Started

### 1. Prerequisites
- C compiler (e.g., GCC, MinGW, or any standard C compiler)

### 2. Compile & Run
Open PowerShell or your terminal and run:
```powershell
gcc Bankers_Algorithm_DeadLock_Avoidance.c -o bankers.exe
./bankers.exe
```
Replace `Bankers_Algorithm_DeadLock_Avoidance.c` with any file you want to run.

For programs with multiple files (like reader-writer), compile together:
```powershell
gcc reader.c writer.c Main_writer_and_reader.c -o rw_sync.exe
./rw_sync.exe
```

## üí° Usage

- Browse the `.c` files to study or modify the code
- Compile and run programs to see how each OS concept works
- Use as a reference for assignments, interviews, or self-study
